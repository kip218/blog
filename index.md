# Hi, I'm Kang In! 
I'm currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity at NYU.  
While my initial reason for pursuing a Computer Science degree was game engineering,  
I eventually picked up an interest in Cybersecurity.  
I have been participating in online [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) as a member of [OSIRIS](https://www.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/) ever since.


### Experience
- *Republic of Korea Air Force: Enlisted Aircraft Mechanic (2019-2021)*
- *NYU TRIO Scholars: Python Tutor (2018-2019)*
