# 👋 Hi, I'm Kang In!
I am currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity at NYU.  
While my initial reason for pursuing a Computer Science degree was game engineering,  
I eventually picked up an interest in Cybersecurity.  
I have been participating in online [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) as a member of [OSIRIS](https://www.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/) ever since.

&nbsp;\\
**Previously, I have worked at:** \\
✈️ *Republic of Korea Air Force* as an *Enlisted Aircraft Mechanic* (2019-2021) \\
👨‍🏫 *NYU TRIO Scholars* as a *Python Tutor* (2018-2019)

&nbsp;\\
**In my free time, I enjoy:** \\
🎮 *Gaming with friends* \\
🏓 *Playing Table Tennis*
