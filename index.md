# 👋 Hi, I'm Kang In!
I am currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity at NYU. \\
While my initial reason for pursuing a Computer Science degree was game engineering, I eventually picked up an interest in Cybersecurity. \\
I have been participating in online [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/){:target="_blank"} as a member of [OSIRIS](https://www.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"} ever since. \\
I am also CompTIA Security+ [certified](/assets/CompTIA_Certificate.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

&nbsp;\\
**Previously, I have worked at:** \\
👨🏼‍💻 [SecurityScorecard](https://securityscorecard.com/){:target="_blank"} as a *Signal Intelligence Collections Intern* (2022) \\
✈️ [Republic of Korea Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea_Air_Force){:target="_blank"} as an *Enlisted Aircraft Mechanic* (2019-2021) \\
👨‍🏫 [NYU TRIO Scholars](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/undergraduate/trio-scholars-program/about-trio){:target="_blank"} as a *Python Tutor* (2018-2019)

**In my free time, I enjoy:** \\
🎮 *Gaming with friends* \\
