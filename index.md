# 👋 Hi, I'm Kang In!
I am currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity at NYU. \\

I have been participating in online [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/){:target="_blank"} as a member of [OSIRIS](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"} ever since. \\
I am also CompTIA Security+ [certified](/assets/CompTIA_Certificate.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
